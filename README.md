1. Clone the repo

2. Install packages
```
sudo apt install nodejs npm
cd server
npm install
```

3. Start WebSocket server in terminal
single start
```
./server.js
```
or infinite loop (the server will be restarted after completion, useful for debugging)
```
./ws-server
```

4. Open client/client.html in web browser as a local file. You can play with multiple instances of the client in browser tabs/windows.
